Technoblade Trinity is a game where our hero, a ninja, parkours the world slaying his foes, in order to reach his goal. This is our first time working in such a big group on such a big project, and was truly an experience to have. Working together on a project was at first a big hinder in our capabilities, but with time, we managed to make use of our individual strengths and come up with a satisfactory result.

To play our game, you will have to run main.py and a menu will pop up. Next, when you click on one of the 4 buttons on the menu to enter a level. When you enter a level, you can press space to jump, right arrow to right, left arrow to go left. You can throw your kunai by right-clicking around where you want the kunai to land. Due to the many blocks in level Easy, the animations don't appear and the kunai throw is laggy. That's why for optimization purposes, you can only throw them in level Easy. You can then press Esc to enter the pause menu, from which you can resume, restart, or go back   to the main menu. You can also press M to die.

Thanks for reading us and have a lot of fun on Technoblade Trinity.

-  By yours truly.
